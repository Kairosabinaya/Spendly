- ✅ Added automatic seeding of default categories for new users

**Files Modified**:
- `hooks/useCategories.tsx` (NEW)
- `components/CategoryManagement.tsx` (NEW)
- `app/(dashboard)/settings/categories/page.tsx` (NEW)
- `components/EnhancedAddExpense.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `data/index.ts` (CLEANED UP)

### 2. **Firebase Security Implementation**
**Problem**: No security rules, anyone could access/modify any data.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive Firestore security rules (`firestore.rules`)
- ✅ Implemented user authentication validation
- ✅ Added data validation for all document types
- ✅ Restricted read/write access to authenticated users only
- ✅ Added field-level validation for expenses, categories, and budgets

**Security Features**:
